  # WriteMe

  ## Description

  WriteMe is a project entirely designed for creating a high quality and professional README automatically. This very README was generated using this application as a showcase of what can be made using WriteMe. Upon executing the index.js file in the terminal using node, the user is prompted with a series of questions that will later fill out their README. All of their inputted information then dynamically fills the page, and a new file called 'README.md.new' is generated in their file.

  ## Installation

  To use WriteMe, the user should clone the repository code to their local machine. Upon having all of the code installed, the user will also need node and access to a terminal to execute it in. Once the user has all of the necessary files downloaded, the user can navigate to the WRITEME file, and in their terminal execute 'npm i' to install the dependencies of the application. Once the install is finished, the user is free to create as many READMEs as they would like.

  ## Usage

  Once the above installation instructions have been completed, the user can then execute the command 'npm index.js' in their terminal to then begin the question prompts for their README generation. It should also be noted that the user will need to ensure that they are in the correct file location via their terminal whenever they generate their README. Once the user has finished inputting all of their answers, the application will generate a 'README.md.new' file in the source folder. This file can then be renamed to remove the '.new' and copied/moved to their desired project.

  ## Tests

  If you are interested in testing my project, please feel free to attempt to refine and optimize my code. I  have not included any automatic testing files myself, but this does not mean I am opposed to them.
